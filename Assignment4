### Goal 
*****
 
The goal of this model is to observe the interactions between individual jobseekers and companies looking for talent. The scope of the model will focus on college seniors in engineering and companies looking to fill entry level engineering roles.

&nbsp;  
### Justification
****
During the recruiting process, both job-seekers and companies are individual actors acting on their own self-interest. Ther

&nbsp; 
### Main Micro-level Processes and Macro-level Dynamics of Interest
****
The key micro-level processes of interest are as follows:
1. Students rank their companies in order of preference
2. Companies rank students whom they interact with in order of preference
3. Students have predetermined strategies of job-seeking
4. Companies have predetermined strategies of recruiting talent
5. There is a likelihood that companies and students interact
6. Companies offer students who meet their recruiting strategy and have interacted with them jobs
7. Students decide whether to accept specific offers
8. This process occurs until the recruiting cycle is complete

The key macro-level dynamics of interest are as follows
1. How does recruiting strategy affect yield?
2. Do certain companies end up without positions being filled?
3. Do any students end up without jobs?
4. As the number of companies increases, does the average value gained through recruiting change?

## Model Outline
****
&nbsp; 
### 1) Environment
_Description of the environment in your model. Things to specify *if they apply*:_

* _Boundary conditions (e.g. wrapping, infinite, etc.)_
* _Dimensionality (e.g. 1D, 2D, etc.)_
* _List of environment-owned variables (e.g. resources, states, roughness)_
* _List of environment-owned methods/procedures (e.g. resource production, state change, etc.)_


```python
# Include first pass of the code you are thinking of using to construct your environment
# This may be a set of "patches-own" variables and a command in the "setup" procedure, a list, an array, or Class constructor
# Feel free to include any patch methods/procedures you have. Filling in with pseudocode is ok! 
# NOTE: If using Netlogo, remove "python" from the markdown at the top of this section to get a generic code block
```

&nbsp; 

### 2) Agents
 
 _Description of the "agents" in the system. Things to specify *if they apply*:_
 
* _List of agent-owned variables (e.g. age, heading, ID, etc.)_
* _List of agent-owned methods/procedures (e.g. move, consume, reproduce, die, etc.)_


```python
# Include first pass of the code you are thinking of using to construct your agents
# This may be a set of "turtle-own" variables and a command in the "setup" procedure, a list, an array, or Class constructor
# Feel free to include any agent methods/procedures you have so far. Filling in with pseudocode is ok! 
# NOTE: If using Netlogo, remove "python" from the markdown at the top of this section to get a generic code block
```

&nbsp; 

### 3) Action and Interaction 
 
**_Interaction Topology_**

_Description of the topology of who interacts with whom in the system. Perfectly mixed? Spatial proximity? Along a network? CA neighborhood?_
 
**_Action Sequence_**

_What does an agent, cell, etc. do on a given turn? Provide a step-by-step description of what happens on a given turn for each part of your model_

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Etc...

&nbsp; 
### 4) Model Parameters and Initialization

_Describe and list any global parameters you will be applying in your model._

_Describe how your model will be initialized_

_Provide a high level, step-by-step description of your schedule during each "tick" of the model_

&nbsp; 

### 5) Assessment and Outcome Measures

_What quantitative metrics and/or qualitative features will you use to assess your model outcomes?_

&nbsp; 

### 6) Parameter Sweep

_What parameters are you most interested in sweeping through? What value ranges do you expect to look at for your analysis?_
